# **SQL Guide**
SQL is a programming language used to manipulate data and databases. RDBMS such as Oracle and MS SQL Server have different versions of SQL. 
<br />

Relational databases organize data into tables. Tables have columns and rows. Columns establish attributes (data types) and rows are records (data points). Primary tables have a primary key which connects to the foreign key from fact tables. Primary keys establish one to many relationships.
<br />

The language is broken down from statement, clauses, then key words.

In a data engineer role, the hardest part is data cleansing because I need the technical aptitude to tell sql what I want it to do. I want to have full control of the language to manipulate data. I want to know how to create my own syntax to solve the problems.
